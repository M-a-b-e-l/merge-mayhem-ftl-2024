# HTML Forms




Check out MDNâ€™s docs on the [HTML input element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) to learn more about other types of input and associated values, attributes, and events.

**Note:** The `form` element itself sets up an area to collect user input but does nothing with the information. This is where JavaScript steps in to process the data and make appropriate actions. This is why it is important to give each element an `id`, `name`, and/or `class`.
